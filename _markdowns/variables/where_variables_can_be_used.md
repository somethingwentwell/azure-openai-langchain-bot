# Where variables can be used **(FREE)**

As it's described in the [CI/CD variables](index.md) documentation, you can
define many different variables. Some of them can be used for all GitLab CI/CD
features, but some of them are more or less limited.

This document describes where and how the different types of variables can be used.

## Variables usage

There are two places defined variables can be used. On the:

1. GitLab side, in the [`.gitlab-ci.yml` file](../yaml/index.md).
1. The GitLab Runner side, in `config.toml`.

### `.gitlab-ci.yml` file

## Expansion mechanisms

There are three expansion mechanisms:

- GitLab
- GitLab Runner
- Execution shell environment

### GitLab internal variable expansion mechanism

The expanded part needs to be in a form of `$variable`, or `${variable}` or `%variable%`.
Each form is handled in the same way, no matter which OS/shell handles the job,
because the expansion is done in GitLab before any runner gets the job.

#### Nested variable expansion

- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/48627) in GitLab 13.10. [Deployed behind the `variable_inside_variable` feature flag](../../user/feature_flags.md), disabled by default.
- [Enabled on GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/297382) in GitLab 14.3.
- [Enabled on self-managed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/297382) in GitLab 14.4.
- Feature flag `variable_inside_variable` removed in GitLab 14.5.

GitLab expands job variable values recursively before sending them to the runner. For example, in the following scenario:

```yaml
- BUILD_ROOT_DIR: '${CI_BUILDS_DIR}'
- OUT_PATH: '${BUILD_ROOT_DIR}/out'
- PACKAGE_PATH: '${OUT_PATH}/pkg'
```

The runner receives a valid, fully-formed path. For example, if `${CI_BUILDS_DIR}` is `/output`, then `PACKAGE_PATH` would be `/output/out/pkg`.

References to unavailable variables are left intact. In this case, the runner
[attempts to expand the variable value](#gitlab-runner-internal-variable-expansion-mechanism) at runtime.
For example, a variable like `CI_BUILDS_DIR` is known by the runner only at runtime.

### GitLab Runner internal variable expansion mechanism

- Supported: project/group variables, `.gitlab-ci.yml` variables, `config.toml` variables, and
  variables from triggers, pipeline schedules, and manual pipelines.
- Not supported: variables defined inside of scripts (for example, `export MY_VARIABLE="test"`).

The runner uses Go's `os.Expand()` method for variable expansion. It means that it handles
only variables defined as `$variable` and `${variable}`. What's also important, is that
the expansion is done only once, so nested variables may or may not work, depending on the
ordering of variables definitions, and whether [nested variable expansion](#nested-variable-expansion)
is enabled in GitLab.

### Execution shell environment

This is an expansion phase that takes place during the `script` execution.
Its behavior depends on the shell used (`bash`, `sh`, `cmd`, PowerShell). For example, if the job's
`script` contains a line `echo $MY_VARIABLE-${MY_VARIABLE_2}`, it should be properly handled
by bash/sh (leaving empty strings or some values depending whether the variables were
defined or not), but don't work with Windows' `cmd` or PowerShell, since these shells
use a different variables syntax.

Supported:

- The `script` may use all available variables that are default for the shell (for example, `$PATH` which
  should be present in all bash/sh shells) and all variables defined by GitLab CI/CD (project/group variables,
  `.gitlab-ci.yml` variables, `config.toml` variables, and variables from triggers and pipeline schedules).
- The `script` may also use all variables defined in the lines before. So, for example, if you define
  a variable `export MY_VARIABLE="test"`:
  - In `before_script`, it works in the subsequent lines of `before_script` and
    all lines of the related `script`.
  - In `script`, it works in the subsequent lines of `script`.
  - In `after_script`, it works in subsequent lines of `after_script`.

In the case of `after_script` scripts, they can:

- Only use variables defined before the script within the same `after_script`
  section.
- Not use variables defined in `before_script` and `script`.

These restrictions exist because `after_script` scripts are executed in a
[separated shell context](../yaml/index.md#after_script).

## Persisted variables

Some predefined variables are called "persisted".

Pipeline-level persisted variables:

- `CI_PIPELINE_ID`
- `CI_PIPELINE_URL`

Job-level persisted variables:

- `CI_JOB_ID`
- `CI_JOB_URL`
- `CI_JOB_TOKEN`
- `CI_JOB_STARTED_AT`
- `CI_REGISTRY_USER`
- `CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD`
- `CI_REPOSITORY_URL`
- `CI_DEPLOY_USER`
- `CI_DEPLOY_PASSWORD`

Persisted variables are:

- Supported for definitions where the ["Expansion place"](#gitlab-ciyml-file) is:
  - Runner.
  - Script execution shell.
- Not supported:
  - For definitions where the ["Expansion place"](#gitlab-ciyml-file) is GitLab.
  - In the `only`, `except`, and `rules` [variables expressions](../jobs/job_control.md#cicd-variable-expressions).

[Pipeline trigger jobs](../yaml/index.md#trigger) cannot use job-level persisted variables,
but can use pipeline-level persisted variables.

Some of the persisted variables contain tokens and cannot be used by some definitions
due to security reasons.

## Variables with an environment scope

Variables defined with an environment scope are supported. Given that
there is a variable `$STAGING_SECRET` defined in a scope of
`review/staging/*`, the following job that is using dynamic environments
is created, based on the matching variable expression:

```yaml
my-job:
  stage: staging
  environment:
    name: review/$CI_JOB_STAGE/deploy
  script:
    - 'deploy staging'
  rules:
    - if: $STAGING_SECRET == 'something'
```
