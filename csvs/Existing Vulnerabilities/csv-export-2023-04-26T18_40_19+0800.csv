This allows older versions of Internet Explorer and Chrome to perform MIME-sniffing on the response body, potentially causing the response body to be interpreted and displayed as a content type other than the declared content type. Current (early 2014) and legacy versions of Firefox will use the declared content type (if one is set), rather than performing MIME-sniffing.",,low,:::http://myservice:8080,,,CWE-693,https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/693.html,"""X-Content-Type-Options Header Missing,https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/blob/w2019-01-14/docs/scanners.md""",2023-03-21 16:44:15 +0800,false,""
